Hey there, My name's Boris, and I'm here to sprinkle a little bit of purrfection into your day.

I’m not just any kitten—I’m super cute, a professional napper, and a mischief-maker with a heart of gold. Whether you're here for snuggles, some cute antics, or just a little distraction from your busy day, I’ve got you covered, but also I can't guarantee I'll be available

## Here's my story

I've spent what felt like years walking the earth looking for a purpose, it was leading up to nothing. I couldn't quite figure myself out, until i stumbled apon this strange place with like gian sized boxes. all different shapes and sizes. I saw some strange figure walk out of one of these things, it did not at all look like somehing like me, it was tall, four legs but for some reason only using two of them to walk, they only had a little tuff of fur on the top of their head. Maybe it a new style I hadn't heard of yet but i will say i will not be a part of. it aproached me slowy, I could say I was a little nervous but pfft, I could take it easy. It reached out one of its legs it wasn't using to walk, I gave it a sniff, smelled.... interesting. All of sudden it just picked me right up off the ground, gotta say it cought me off guard, I decided to hold back my anger and sharp claws to see where thing was taking me. We were headed towards the box it came out of. Next thing I knew, I was getting pet bet by like 4 different huge, furrless cats. To this day I'm living happily in this big box with all my friends and food.
